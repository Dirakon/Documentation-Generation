["<explanation>\nThis EO code implements a complete application that manages program version data, persists it to the filesystem, and produces an RSS feed of version history. The main object “app” initializes a file system state path (from the first argument) and then enters an infinite loop. In that loop it:\n• Reads configuration data and logs status messages (e.g. “Reading...”, “Getting current version”, “Writing...”).\n• Calls a “while” loop that repeatedly:\n  – Reads the stored data using the “currently-saved-data” function.\n  – Retrieves the current version via the “version” function (which combines an external version number with the current timestamp).\n  – Updates (“actualizes”) the stored data with the new version.\n  – Persists the updated data by writing it back through the “program-data-storage” structure.\n  – Outputs an RSS feed using the “output-as-rss” function, which builds a formatted XML feed by combining a header (prefix), a dynamically generated middle part (RSS items for each version), and a footer (suffix).\nAdditional helper objects include:\n• “program-data-storage” – constructs and manages file paths, reading from and writing to these files.\n• “program-data” – manages a list of program versions and is responsible for generating an RSS feed.\n• “program-version” – a simple helper that constructs a version record from a version number and a timestamp.\n• “external” – a collection of functions simulating external interactions (logging, file I/O, sending commands, and reading responses). Overall, the code uses EO’s minimalistic functional style with indentation determining parameter passing and sequential execution.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  external.log > @\n    \"Test log\"\n  external.line-counter > @\n    3\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nLog:\nTest log\n(lines: 3)\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis object implements a simple “data‐storage” abstraction for program data. When instantiated with a state path it provides three functions:\n1. data-file – given a branch and a program name, it computes a file object by joining the state path with the branch and program name. It also obtains a directory (from the file’s dirname) and ensures that the directory is “made” before returning the file.\n2. read – when passed a branch and program name, it first gets the associated data file and its path. It then checks if that file exists. If yes, it reads its entire content, splits it by newline, and maps each line into a version (by parsing using a sscanf‐pattern) to reconstruct “program data”. Otherwise, it returns an “empty” program-data list.\n3. write – given a program-data instance (which contains branch, program name, and a list of version records), it first obtains the file that will store the data. Then it “reduces” the version list into a serialized string (each version is rendered as “version-number|||timestamp” followed by a newline). It logs the serialized version string and then writes it to the file. (The call to external.write sends a command and waits for confirmation via standard input.)\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > dummy-version\n  \"v1.0\" > version-number\n  1000 > timestamp\n\n[] > dummy-list\n  [accum version] > reduced\n    \"v1.0|||1000\n\" > @\n\n[] > dummy-instance\n  \"develop\" > branch\n  \"myapp\" > program-name\n  dummy-list > versions\n\n# Instantiate program-data-storage with a dummy state-path\n\"/tmp\" > state\nstate > program-data-storage.state-path\n\n[] > storage\n  state > program-data-storage.state-path\n\n# Call the write function on our dummy instance; note that external.write will request a confirmation input.\nstorage.program-data-storage.write > @\n  dummy-instance\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\nOK\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nLog:\n(lines: 2)\nv1.0|||1000\nRequest: write-file|||/tmp/develop/myapp\n(lines: 2)\nv1.0|||1000\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis structure defines an object “program-data” that encapsulates the versioning information for a program. It accepts three parameters: a branch name, a program name, and a list of version records. The object contains two main subfunctions:\n• “output-as-rss”: This parameterless function builds and outputs an RSS feed. It first creates a prefix string (an XML header and channel details) using the program name and branch. Then it maps over the list of version records to print each version as an RSS <item> (using version number and timestamp). Finally, it prints a suffix to close the XML structure. It also computes the total expected line count (by adding a fixed number of header and footer lines plus a multiple of the number of versions) and uses an external helper “line-counter” to log that count.\n• “actualized”: This function takes a new version as parameter. It checks if this new version already exists (by comparing with the last element of the current versions list). If so, it leaves the versions unchanged; otherwise, it appends the new version.\nAdditionally, a helper function “program-version” is defined separately to construct a version record from a version number and a timestamp. An “external” object (nested under “program-data”) defines various support utilities (logging, file I/O, sending commands) that “output-as-rss” uses.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Create a single version record using program-version with version \"v1.0\" and a sample timestamp.\n  * > versions\n    program-version > @\n      \"v1.0\"\n      1609459200\n  # Build the program-data object with branch \"stable\", program name \"TestApp\" and the versions list.\n  \"stable\" > branch\n  \"TestApp\" > program-name\n  program-data > pd\n    branch\n    program-name\n    versions\n  # Invoke output-as-rss to print the generated RSS content to stdout.\n  pd.output-as-rss > @\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n \n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nRss:\n(lines: 15)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>TestApp versions</title>\n  <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=stable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=TestApp</link>\n  <description>History of versions</description>\n\n  <item>\n    <title>v1.0</title>\n    <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=stable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=TestApp</link>\n    <description>New version at 1609459200</description>\n  </item>\n</channel>\n\n</rss>\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis function, named “actualized”, is defined as part of the program-data object. It accepts a single parameter “new-version” and returns a new program-data instance where the versions list is potentially updated. The function works by checking whether “new-version” is already the most recent version in the current versions list. It does so by:\n • Using last-index-of on the versions list and comparing it with (versions.length.minus 1) while also ensuring that the versions list is not empty.\n • If the new version is already at the end, the function leaves the list unchanged.\n • Otherwise, it appends the new version using versions.with.\nThis mechanism prevents duplicate appends when the incoming version is identical to the last recorded version.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Create a dummy program-data instance with an initial versions list\n  [branch program-name versions] > dummy-data\n    \"alpha\"            # branch\n    \"demo\"             # program-name\n    * \n      \"v1.0\"\n      \"v1.1\"\n\n  # Test case 1: Call actualized with a version that is already the latest (\"v1.1\")\n  dummy-data.actualized > result1\n    \"v1.1\"\n\n  # Test case 2: Call actualized with a new version (\"v1.2\") that should be appended\n  dummy-data.actualized > result2\n    \"v1.2\"\n\n  # Output the versions list from both results to verify the behavior\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    QQ.txt.sprintf\n      \"Result1 versions: %s\\n\"\n      result1.versions\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    QQ.txt.sprintf\n      \"Result2 versions: %s\\n\"\n      result2.versions\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nResult1 versions: [v1.0, v1.1]\nResult2 versions: [v1.0, v1.1, v1.2]\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThe \"program-version\" function is defined with two parameters: version-number and timestamp. Its sole responsibility is to return the version-number, effectively ignoring the timestamp. This means that when provided with a version tuple (a version identifier and its corresponding timestamp), the function outputs only the version identifier.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  program-version > result\n    \"1.2.3\"\n    1609459200\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    result\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\n1.2.3\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis EO object “external” abstracts several helper functions that simulate interactions with external system components. It starts by declaring two constant values: an empty string (as the object’s default value) and a command‐separator (\"|||\") used to join command parts. The object then defines a series of functions:\n• line-counter: Receives a line count and outputs a formatted string showing the number of lines.\n• output-multiline: Converts a given content value to text, splits it into lines, then uses line-counter to print the count and prints each line.\n• log: Prepends a “Log:” header and delegates to output-multiline to display the provided text.\n• write: Given a file and some content, it builds a “write-file” command (using a chained combination of the command name, separator, and the file path), sends that command, outputs the content in multiline format, and waits for a confirmation from the caller (via stdin).\n• read: For a given file, it builds a “read-file” command and sends it. It then reads metadata, extracts the expected line count from that metadata, reads that many lines from stdin, and joins them into one content string.\n• send-command: Prints a “Request:” message along with the provided command to simulate sending a command.\n• get-response and get-confirmation: Both wait for and return one line from standard input. They are used to simulate waiting for external responses.\n• version: Takes a branch and program-name, builds a “get-version” command by chaining these parts (with the command-separator), sends it, and then returns the response (the version number) it obtains.\n• branch and program-name: Each sends a corresponding request (for branch or program-name) and returns the response from stdin.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Test the logging function\n  external.log > @\n    \"Test log message\"\n  \n  # Test sending a command\n  external.send-command > @\n    \"dummy-command\"\n  \n  # Test getting a version from external using branch \"master\" and program name \"demo\"\n  external.version > version-out\n    \"master\"\n    \"demo\"\n  \n  # Output the returned version string\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    version-out\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\nv1.0.0\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nLog:\n(lines: 1)\nTest log message\nRequest: dummy-command\nRequest: get-version|||master|||demo\nv1.0.0\n</doctest-output>"]
