["<explanation>\nApplication that continuously monitors and outputs RSS feed of a program's version history. It runs in an infinite loop, retrieves current branch/program name, fetches latest version data, stores it persistently via `program-data-storage`, and generates an RSS XML output. Uses external data sources/APIs (via `external` module) for fetching versions, with state persisted via disk files. The RSS output includes version history entries with timestamps and links, and includes metadata like line counts for debugging.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nManages persistent storage for program data versions. Stores data in files organized by branch and program name under a specified state path. Provides read/write operations to serialize/deserialize version history from disk. Files are stored in nested directories matching branch/program-name structure, with each file containing newline-separated \"version|||timestamp\" entries.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nA program-data object holding metadata about a software program's versions. It contains two key functions:\n1. `output-as-rss` generates an RSS feed XML string listing all versions. It constructs the RSS structure with channel metadata, iterates over versions to create individual XML items showing version numbers, timestamps, and associated links, and adds line-count tracking for logging purposes.\n2. `actualized` updates the version list with a new version. It checks if the new version is already the last entry in the list before adding it, ensuring proper version history maintenance while avoiding duplicates.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nUpdates program data versions by adding the new version only if it hasn't been recorded as the latest entry. Ensures no duplicate entries where the new version already exists as the last element, maintaining clean version history. Returns new program-data instance with either the unchanged or extended versions list.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nEncapsulates a program version with its number and associated timestamp, returning the version number when evaluated. The timestamp is stored but not directly exposed through the primary accessor.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nManages communication with external processes through a command-based protocol. Provides functions to send structured command requests via stdout, read responses from stdin, and handle file operations, logging, and version checks using predefined command formats and separators.  \n</explanation>"]
