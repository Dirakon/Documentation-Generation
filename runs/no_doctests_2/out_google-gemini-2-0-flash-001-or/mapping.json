["```\n<explanation>\nThis code manages program version data, storing it in files and providing an RSS feed of version history.\n\n*   **`app`**: The main object that takes command line arguments (`args`). It reads program version information, stores it, and generates an RSS feed.  It initializes the `state-path` from the first command line argument. It then loops indefinitely, retrieving program and branch names, reading existing data, fetching the current version, updating the program data, and writing it to storage.\n*\t**`version`**: Retrieves the version number of a program from an external source and combines it with the current time in seconds.\n*   **`currently-saved-data`**: Reads existing program data from storage.\n*   **`current-time`**: Gets the current time using POSIX system calls.\n*   **`program-data-storage`**: Handles reading and writing program data to files within a specified state path. `data-file` defines the path to an individual file for the program, while `read` and `write` deal with file IO.\n*   **`program-data`**: Represents the data for a specific program, including its branch, program name, and version history. It includes logic for updating this data by actualizing new versions, as well as a function to output the data as an RSS feed (`output-as-rss`).  The RSS feed generation involves formatting the program name, branch, and version history into an XML string. Also `actualized` function updates the program data by adding a new version to the history, taking care no to add identical versions to the and of the versions.\n*   **`program-version`**: A simple object that combines a version number and a timestamp.\n*   **`external`**: Provides an abstraction over external commands and data retrieval. It includes functions for logging, writing to files,reading from files, and retrieving branch and program names. These functions communicate with an external system (potentially through standard input/output) to perform these actions. It exposes `line-counter` function, as well as `log` function to standard out to write additional information.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nObject that is responsible for reading and writing program data to a file system. It takes the root `state-path` as input to locate the files, and then provides methods for finding and reading the necessary files.\n\n- `data-file`: constructs a `QQ.fs.file` object representing the data file path for a specific branch and program name, combining the `state-path`, branch, and program name. It checks for directory existence and creates it if needed. The result of that function is name of the data files.\n- `read`: Reads program data from a file (if it exists) and creates a `program-data` object.  If the file exists, it reads the content, splits it into lines, and creates `program-version` instances for each line. If the file doesn't exist, it creates an empty `program-data` object.\n- `write`: Writes the serialized versions of a `program-data-instance` to a file. The data is serialized in the format \"version-number|||timestamp\\n\".\n\nAll these parameters are persisted to be available during the next execution of app.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThis object represents the data for a specific program, including its versions. \n\nIt takes the `branch`, `program-name`, and a list of `versions` as input.\n\nThe `output-as-rss` function generates an RSS feed representing the program's version history and prints it to standard output. It formats the output as XML. It creates the prefix, the middle part by traversing the versions object and using the data there and the suffix for the rss data before outputting it to the terminal.\n\nThe `actualized` function either appends a new version to the list of `versions` or returns the existing list if the new version is already the latest. Checks are in place to avoid having the same version twice in a row.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThis function takes `new-version` as input, checks if this version is already the latest version in the `versions` list. If it is, and the `versions` list is not empty, it returns the original `versions` list. Otherwise, it creates a new version of program data, and with the new version added at the end of the list and returns this new list as the default value `@`.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nObject representing the version of a program. It takes the version number and timestamp as input and evaluates to the version number.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nObject acting as an interactor with the external world. All the functions will output a request through stdout and obtain a response through stdin. All responses from stdin should be validated, unless the request itself failed for some reason.\n</explanation>\n```"]
