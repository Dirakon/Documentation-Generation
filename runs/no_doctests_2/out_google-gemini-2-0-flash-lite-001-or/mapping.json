["```\n<explanation>\nThe `app` object that takes command line arguments as `args` and runs an update loop utilizing information provided to it.  It retrieves the program's state path,  uses a `while` loop, gets current version, saves data to the state, and outputs an RSS feed.  The main part is reading, writing, getting and updating the version of the application.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nAn object for storing and retrieving program data to/from files. It takes a `state-path` argument which determines where to read/write files from.  It defines the `data-file` object, which constructs a file path based on a branch and program name.  It also contains `read` function, which reads the data from the file, splits it by lines, and processes it. The `write` function writes the provided `program-data-instance` to the designated file.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nAn object representing data associated with a program's versioning.  It takes the branch name, program name, and a list of versions as arguments. It contains methods to output current version as an RSS feed and also to actualize the given version.\n`output-as-rss` creates and prints an RSS feed to the standard output, while `actualized` updates the current data  with a new version, creating new object, based on whether or not new version already exists.\n`program-version` is another function inside of it that returns program version, which combines the version number and timestamp.\n</explanation>\n```","<explanation>\nThis object defines how to update and output program version data. It takes program arguments, retrieves the program's state path, and then enters a loop to read, get the current version, and write its data:\n\n*   `app`: The main application object. It takes the arguments as input, which are used to determine the path to the program data storage. The app retrieves the state path from arguments, and in a loop: reads existing data and fetches current version, updates data with current version, writes new data and then outputs it as RSS. Also includes `version` and `currently-saved-data` functions that each perform a single small action.\n*   `program-data-storage`: Manages the storage interaction of the program data. Takes `state-path` as an argument and defines file-based storage logic for the program data, including reading and writing data. Defines `data-file`, `read` and `write` objects.\n*   `program-data`: Represents the data of a program, including a list of versions. It outputs the versions in RSS format. Contains `output-as-rss` (outputs data in XML format), and `actualized` - function, which combines current set of versions with the new version.\n*   `program-version`: Represents a single version of the program.\n*   `external`: An object that abstracts external operations, such as logging, reading/writing files, and retrieving program information and version.\n</explanation>\n","```\n<explanation>\nAn object representing a single version of a program. It takes version number and timestamp as parameters and returns the version number.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nObject that provides various external utility functions. It includes functions for logging with `log`, writing and reading from files with `write` and `read`, sending commands, and retrieving version, branch, and program name information. It uses internal functions like `output-multiline`, `send-command`, `get-response`, and `get-confirmation` to manage these operations.\n</explanation>\n```"]
