["<explanation>\nThe provided EO code defines an application that appears to be designed for managing and tracking program versions. It uses an external system, likely a command-line interface, to retrieve and update version information. The application is structured around several key functions and objects, including `app`, `program-data`, `program-version`, and `external`.\n\nThe `app` function serves as the main entry point, taking a list of arguments and initializing the application state. It uses the `seq` function to execute a sequence of operations, including reading the current version, retrieving saved data, and writing updated data.\n\nThe `program-data` object represents the data associated with a specific program, including its name, branch, and versions. The `output-as-rss` function generates an RSS feed based on the program's version history.\n\nThe `external` object provides an interface to interact with the external system, allowing the application to send commands, read files, and log messages. The `version` function retrieves the current version of a program, and the `program-version` object represents a specific version of a program.\n\nThe application uses a combination of built-in EO functions, such as `seq`, `mapped`, and `chained`, to manage the flow of data and execute operations. It also defines several custom functions, including `actualized`, `write`, and `read`, to handle specific tasks related to program version management.\n\nOverall, the code provides a framework for managing program versions, generating RSS feeds, and interacting with an external system. However, the specific details of the external system and the context in which the application is deployed are not explicitly defined in the provided code.\n</explanation>",
	"## Explanation\nObject that encapsulates the data storage for a program, providing methods to read and write data files. It takes a state path as an argument and uses it to construct file paths for data storage. The object has two main methods: `read` and `write`. The `read` method retrieves data from a file, parses it into a list of program versions, and returns a `program-data` object. The `write` method takes a `program-data` object, serializes its versions into a string, and writes it to a file. The object also provides a `data-file` method that constructs a file path for a given branch and program name.","<explanation>\nA data structure that holds program data, including its name, branch, and a list of versions. It provides methods to output the data as an RSS string and to actualize the data with a new version.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nUpdates the program-data with a new version, returning the updated program-data. If the new version is the latest version, it is added to the list of versions. Otherwise, the list of versions remains unchanged.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nA data structure representing a specific version of a program, which is defined by its version number and a timestamp.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThe `external` object provides a set of functions to interact with an external system, likely a command-line interface or a network connection. It includes functions for logging, writing to files, reading from files, sending commands, and retrieving responses. The object appears to be a wrapper around a communication protocol, using a command separator (\"|||\") to format commands and data. The functions within the `external` object are designed to handle various tasks, such as outputting multiline text, logging messages, and confirming actions. The object seems to be a crucial component in the overall system, enabling communication with external entities and facilitating data exchange.\n</explanation>"]
