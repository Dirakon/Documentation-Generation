["<explanation>\nApplication that continuously monitors and updates program version data, generating an RSS feed. It maintains state persistence through file storage, interacts with external commands for version checking/IO operations, and handles XML output formatting for version history. The core loop reads current state, checks for new versions, writes updated data to storage, and produces RSS output with version timestamps.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nHandles storage and retrieval of program version data in files. It constructs file paths based on branch and program name, checks for existing data, reads and parses version history from files (using \"|||\" as separator), and writes serialized version data back to storage. Includes directory creation guarantees and version data serialization/deserialization operations.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nRepresents program version data and generates an RSS feed output. Manages version history by:\n1. Storing branch, program name, and version list\n2. Providing XML-formatted RSS output with channel metadata and version items\n3. Handling version updates through actualization (only adds new versions if different from last)\n4. Including timestamps and version numbers in RSS items with NixOS search links\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nUpdates the program data by adding a new version if it's not already the latest. Checks if the new version is identical to the current latest version (using last index comparison) and only adds it when either versions list is empty or the new version differs from existing ones. Returns either original versions list or updated list with new version appended.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nRepresents a software version with a version number and timestamp, where the version number serves as the primary identifier and evaluation result.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nInterface for external system interactions, handling commands, logging, file I/O, and version control through a structured protocol. Provides functions to send/receive formatted requests/responses via standard streams, manage file operations with line counting, and retrieve program metadata from external sources using a \"|||\" command separator syntax.\n</explanation>"]
