["<explanation>\nThis object represents the main application that continuously monitors, updates, and outputs version data for a program. It starts by determining the state storage path from the command-line arguments and then enters an infinite loop. In each iteration, it uses external commands to obtain the branch and program name, logs messages, reads the currently saved program data from a file, retrieves the current version (augmented with a timestamp), and “actualizes” the data by updating its version history. The updated data is then written back to persistent storage and output as an RSS feed. The structure also includes helper functions for obtaining the current time, managing file-based storage (reading and writing), constructing version data, and handling external I/O operations.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis object, program-data-storage, manages persistent storage for program data using a given state path. It computes a file location (via data-file) by joining the base state path with the branch and program name, ensuring that the corresponding directory is created. Its read function checks if the file exists and, if so, reads its content, splitting it by newlines to parse each version entry into a program-version structure; if the file is absent, it returns an empty dataset. The write function serializes the program data’s versions by concatenating each version’s number and timestamp (using a specific delimiter), logs the serialized string, writes it to the computed file, and finally returns the updated data instance.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis object encapsulates the version history of a program identified by a branch and its name. It holds a list of version entries and provides two main functionalities. The first, output-as-rss, constructs and outputs an RSS feed representing the version history by formatting an XML header, iterating over each version to produce an RSS item (including details like version number and timestamp), and appending an XML footer. The second function, actualized, updates the version list by checking if a given new version is already the latest entry; if not, it appends the new version and returns the updated data.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis function updates the program data with a new version. It takes a new version as its argument and, using a conditional check, determines whether the new version is already the last element of the versions list (and that the list isn’t empty). If the new version is a duplicate of the most recent version, it returns the original versions unchanged; otherwise, it appends the new version to the list.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis object represents a program version. It is defined with two attributes—a version number and a timestamp—but its evaluation simply yields the version number.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nProvides a suite of utility functions for interacting with external systems. It formats and sends commands (e.g., for reading, writing, getting version, branch or program-name), outputs multiline logs and text to stdout, reads responses from stdin, and manages simple command-line protocol interactions.\n</explanation>"]
